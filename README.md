# Project_Flutter

Welcome to our collaborative Flutter project! Our goal is to create a feature-rich mobile application using Flutter and integrating it with a web API.

## Key Objectives
- **Web API Integration:** The application will interact with a web API.
- **Screen Dynamics:** The app will feature a set of screens, each designed for utility, with the number of screens being twice the number of group members (e.g., 2 members = 4 screens, 3 members = 6 screens).

Used API: New York Times Book API (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview)
